# Recipe Meal Planner

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

I love cooking and baking so I made a recipe meal planner app. This way I can keep all my recipes in one place whilst also keeping track of which items I have in my pantry. It takes a way the stress of finding recipes and allows me to not have to exhast all my creativity on planning my weakly meals.

Users can signup and the login or logout. Users can view all the ingredients in the database and add them to their pantry. The can view their pantry and modify the quantity of the ingredient. Users can search for recipes using the edemam api with the ingredients they have in their pantry. They can favourite the recipes they like and add the ingredients that recipe needs.

I installed a react heart library to favourite my recipes and a react calendar to plan my meals

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need to have the backend code [link](https://github.com/rivkicobersy/capstone-api) running on http://localhost:3000.
You can view the app on http://localhost:5173.

## Roadmap

I would like to implement a calnedar scheduler API so that I would be able to add recipes to different days of the week.
I started working on a mobile phone app using react native and I wanted to continue exploring that.
